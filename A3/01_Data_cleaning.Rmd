### Dataset 

Import the data and check the variables.

```{r data_import}

# Import cleaned dataset
data <- read_csv("https://osf.io/3qyut/download") 

```

```{r}

# Check summary statistics
datasummary_skim(data, 'numeric') 

```

There are 46412 individual firms in the dataset for 2005-2016 period. For the further analysis, I will restrict the dataset for the 2011-2014 periods (one lagging, 2 leading periods are needed for the 2012 cross-section).

The following fields have high missing rates (above 90%) : COGS, finished_prod, net_dom_sales, net_exp_sales. I will drop these variables from the dataset.

```{r}

# Keep only 2011-2014
data <- data %>%
  filter((year >= 2011) & (year <= 2014) & (balsheet_length >= 360))

# Drop variables with many NAs
data <- data %>%
  select(-c(COGS, finished_prod, net_dom_sales, net_exp_sales, wages)) 

```


### Label engineering

The target variable the growth rate over two years which was defined using the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) formula:

![](C:/Users/User/Documents/GitHub/CEU-DA3/A3/output/formula.jpg){ width=30% }


* The sales revenue was converted to million EUR first and 
* For new firms (age <= 1 or no full year balance sheet available) and for firms that left the market the growth rate was modified to zero.

```{r}

# Create all year - comp_id combination (NAs will be added to missing combinations)
#data <- data %>%
 # complete(year, comp_id)

# Generate status_alive; if sales larger than zero and not-NA, then firm is alive
data  <- data %>%
  mutate(status_alive = sales > 0 & !is.na(sales) %>%
           as.numeric(.))

# Create growth variables - Floor sales to 1, rescale and create logs
data <- data %>%
  mutate(sales = ifelse(sales < 0, 1, sales), # Floor sales to 1
         sales_lag1 = Lag(sales),
         ln_sales = ifelse(sales > 0, log(sales), 0),
         sales_mil=sales/1000000, # Create sales in million
         sales_mil_log = ifelse(sales > 0, log(sales_mil), 0)) # Create log of million sales

# Create square of sales mil
data <- data %>%
  mutate(sales_mil_log_sq=sales_mil_log^2)

# Create first difference
data <- data %>%
  group_by(comp_id) %>%
  mutate(d1_sales_mil_log = sales_mil_log - Lag(sales_mil_log, 1)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Add 0 sales change for new firms (age <= 1 or no balance sheet available for the year)
data <- data %>%
  mutate(age = (year - founded_year) %>%
           ifelse(. < 0, 0, .),
         new = as.numeric(age <= 1) %>% #  (age could be 0,1 )
           ifelse(balsheet_notfullyear == 1, 1, .),
         d1_sales_mil_log = ifelse(new == 1, 0, d1_sales_mil_log),
         new = ifelse(is.na(d1_sales_mil_log) , 1, new), # if no data is available for the last year then the company is new
         d1_sales_mil_log = ifelse(is.na(d1_sales_mil_log), 0, d1_sales_mil_log)
         )

# Winsorize the tails [-1.5, 1.5]
data <- data %>%
  mutate(flag_low_d1_sales_mil_log = ifelse(d1_sales_mil_log < -1.5, 1, 0),
         flag_high_d1_sales_mil_log = ifelse(d1_sales_mil_log > 1.5, 1, 0),
         d1_sales_mil_log_mod = ifelse(d1_sales_mil_log < -1.5, -1.5,
                                       ifelse(d1_sales_mil_log > 1.5, 1.5, d1_sales_mil_log)),
         d1_sales_mil_log_mod_sq = d1_sales_mil_log_mod^2)


data <- data %>%
  group_by(comp_id) %>%
  mutate(sales_growth_2 = ((lead(sales_mil, 2) / sales_mil)^(1/2)-1 ) * 100) %>%
  ungroup()

# Example
data_ch <- data %>% filter(comp_id == '1001541') %>%  select(comp_id, year, sales, sales_mil, sales_growth_2) %>% arrange(comp_id)

kable(data_ch) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 11, full_width = F) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "900px")


```


### Sample design

2012 cross section was selected for the sample.

* Only kept alive firms (with sales > 0)
* Filtered out firms with very low (below 1000 EUR) and very high (above 10M EUR) sales.
* Firms that did not have 4 years available (2011-2014) data were excluded.
* Filtered out firms with missing growth rate.
* The sample consists of 13.339 firms

```{r}

# 2012 cross section and filter for alive firms and firms below 10m euro revenues and above 1000 euros
data <- data %>%
  filter(status_alive == 1) %>%
  filter(!(sales_mil > 10)) %>%
  filter(!(sales_mil < 0.001))  

# Keep only firms with complete 4 yers data
complete_filter <- data %>% group_by(comp_id) %>% dplyr::summarize(count_per = n()) %>% filter(count_per == 4)
data <- data %>% filter(comp_id %in% complete_filter$comp_id)

# Keep with available growth rate and 2012 cross-section
data <- data %>% 
          filter(!is.na(sales_growth_2)) %>% 
          filter(year == 2012)

```

Let's check the growth rate.

```{r}

# Histogram of sales growth
p1 <- ggplot( data  , aes(x = sales_growth_2)) +
    geom_histogram( aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)), binwidth = 5, fill="#238b45", color = 'gray50', na.rm = T) +
    labs(y = 'Percent',x = "Sales growth" ) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(1)) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(size = 12L,
                                face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
      axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold"),
      axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold"),
      legend.position = "none")

p2 <- ggplot( data %>% filter(sales_growth_2 < 500)  , aes(x = sales_growth_2)) +
    geom_histogram( aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)), binwidth = 5, fill="#238b45", color = 'gray50', na.rm = T) +
    labs(y = 'Percent',x = "Sales growth" ) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(1)) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(
      plot.title = element_text(size = 12L,
                                face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
      axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold"),
      axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold"),
      legend.position = "none")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)


```

The distribution of the growth rates are centered close to zero with a long right tail. There are 7 firms with extreme high growth rate above 1000%. 

```{r}

kable(data %>% filter(sales_growth_2 > 1000)) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 11, full_width = F) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "900px")

```


For the analysis I will exclude firms with growth rate above 2000% as such record high growth rate is unlikely among SMEs.

```{r}

data <- data %>% filter(sales_growth_2 < 2000)
  
```


In order to decide about the cutoff value for fast growing, let's check the summary statistics of the growth rate.

```{r}

# Summary
P60 <- function(x){quantile(x,0.60,na.rm=T)}
P65 <- function(x){quantile(x,0.65,na.rm=T)}
P70 <- function(x){quantile(x,0.70,na.rm=T)}
P75 <- function(x){quantile(x,0.75,na.rm=T)}
P80 <- function(x){quantile(x,0.80,na.rm=T)}
P85 <- function(x){quantile(x,0.85,na.rm=T)}
P90 <- function(x){quantile(x,0.90,na.rm=T)}
P95 <- function(x){quantile(x,0.95,na.rm=T)}
P05 <- function(x){quantile(x,0.05,na.rm=T)}
# Range <- function(x){max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)}
Missing <- function(x){sum(is.na(x))}
Mean2 <- function(x){mean(x,na.rm=T)}

datasummary(  (sales_growth_2)  ~ 
    (N + Missing + Mean2 + SD + Min + Max + P05 + Median  + P60 + P65 + P70 + P75 + P80 + P85 + P90 + P95),
    data = data,
    title = 'Descriptive statistics of growth rate' ) %>% 
    kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position", font_size = 10)


```

The mean growth rate is 10.81%. From the percentiles we can see that about 30-35% of the firms have higher growth rate. With 25% growth rate 20% of the firms will be classified as fast growing and with 30% about 15%. For classification it is needed to have enough observations in each group so I would choose 30% as a round cutoff value. 

```{r}

# Add fast growing flag as growth rate > 30%
data <- data %>% mutate(fast_growing_flg = ifelse(sales_growth_2 > 30, 1, 0))

# Create factor
data <- data %>%
  mutate(fast_growing_f = factor(fast_growing_flg, levels = c(0,1)) %>%
           recode(., `0` = 'not_fast_growing', `1` = "fast_growing"))

```

Let's check the number of firms by the fast growing flag.

```{r}

kable(data %>% group_by(fast_growing_flg) %>%  dplyr::summarize(count = n())) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 11, full_width = F) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "900px")

```

We have 11.129 observations in the baseline and 2207 obseravtions in the fast growing group.

### Feature engineering - Industry andrelated variables 

Industry related variables were created:

* ind2_cat: Industry categories were grouped and converted to factor
* age and age squared
* factors were created from the characters: gender_m, m_region_loc, urban_m

```{r}

# Industry category codes grouped
data <- data %>%
  mutate(ind2_cat = ind2 %>%
           ifelse(. > 56, 60, .)  %>%
           ifelse(. < 26, 20, .) %>%
           ifelse(. < 55 & . > 35, 40, .) %>%
           ifelse(. == 31, 30, .) %>%
           ifelse(is.na(.), 99, .)
           )

# Other industry variables: age, foreign, gender, region
data <- data %>%
  mutate(age2 = age^2,
         gender_m = factor(gender, levels = c("female", "male", "mix")),
         m_region_loc = factor(region_m, levels = c("Central", "East", "West")))

# Create factors for urban, industry
data <- data %>%
  mutate(urban_m = factor(urban_m, levels = c(1,2,3)),
         ind2_cat = factor(ind2_cat, levels = sort(unique(data$ind2_cat))))

```



### Feature engineering - Financial variables

Financial variables were corrected and transformed:

* Asset side variables (intang_assets, curr_assets, fixed_assets) with negative values were floored at 0 as they cannot be negative. 
* flag_asset_problem: Flag for assets with negative value was added to measure the quality of the financial variables.
* total_assets_bs: Total assets were calculated from the asset side items.
* Ratios were created from the asset side items by dividing them by the total asset (suffixed with 'bs_')
* Ratios were created from the P&L items by dividing them by the sales value (suffixed with 'pl_')

```{r}

# Assets can't be negative. Floor them to 0 and add a flag
data <-data  %>%
  mutate(flag_asset_problem=ifelse(intang_assets<0 | curr_assets<0 | fixed_assets<0,1,0  ))

data <- data %>%
  mutate(intang_assets = ifelse(intang_assets < 0, 0, intang_assets),
         curr_assets = ifelse(curr_assets < 0, 0, curr_assets),
         fixed_assets = ifelse(fixed_assets < 0, 0, fixed_assets))

# Generate total assets
data <- data %>%
  mutate(total_assets_bs = intang_assets + curr_assets + fixed_assets)

# Create ratios of financial variables
#   - Divide P&L items by sales
#   - Divide asset items by total assets

pl_names <- c("extra_exp","extra_inc",  "extra_profit_loss", "inc_bef_tax" ,"inventories",
              "material_exp", "profit_loss_year", "personnel_exp")
bs_names <- c("intang_assets", "curr_liab", "fixed_assets", "liq_assets", "curr_assets",
              "share_eq", "subscribed_cap", "tang_assets" )

# P&L items; add names_pl elements to new column name
data <- data %>%
  mutate_at(vars(pl_names), funs("pl"=./sales))

# BS items; add names_bs elements to new column name
data <- data %>%
  mutate_at(vars(bs_names), funs("bs"=ifelse(total_assets_bs == 0, 0, ./total_assets_bs)))

```


### Feature engineering - Financial variables - Winsorize and create flags

* Financial ratios calculated from financial items that cannot be negative were winsorized to have values between [0, 1]
  * Flag values were added to track data issues:
    * 'flag_high' suffix was added to capture ratios above 1
    * 'flag_error' suffix was added to capture ratios with negative values
* Financial ratios calculated from financial items that can be negative were winsorized to have values between [-1, 1] 
  * Flag values were added to track data issues:
    * 'flag_high' suffix was added to capture ratios above 1
    * 'flag_low' suffix was added to capture ratios below -1
    * 'flag_zero' suffix was added to capture ratios with 0 values
  * Quadratics were added suffixed with 'quad'
  
```{r}

# Variables that represent accounting items that cannot be negative (add 0 for negatives, add 1 for above 1)
zero <-  c("extra_exp_pl", "extra_inc_pl", "inventories_pl", "material_exp_pl", "personnel_exp_pl",
           "curr_liab_bs", "fixed_assets_bs", "liq_assets_bs", "curr_assets_bs", "subscribed_cap_bs",
           "intang_assets_bs")

data <- data %>%
  mutate_at(vars(zero), funs("flag_high"= as.numeric(.> 1))) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(zero), funs(ifelse(.> 1, 1, .))) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(zero), funs("flag_error"= as.numeric(.< 0))) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(zero), funs(ifelse(.< 0, 0, .)))

# For vars that could be any, but are mostly between -1 and 1 (add -1 for below -1, add 1 for above 1)
any <-  c("extra_profit_loss_pl", "inc_bef_tax_pl", "profit_loss_year_pl", "share_eq_bs")

data <- data %>%
  mutate_at(vars(any), funs("flag_low"= as.numeric(.< -1))) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(any), funs(ifelse(.< -1, -1, .))) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(any), funs("flag_high"= as.numeric(.> 1))) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(any), funs(ifelse(.> 1, 1, .))) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(any), funs("flag_zero"= as.numeric(.== 0))) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(any), funs("quad"= .^2))

# Drop flags with no variation
variances <- data %>%
  select(contains("flag")) %>%
  apply(2, var, na.rm = TRUE) == 0

data <- data %>%
  select(-one_of(names(variances)[variances]))

```

### Feature engineering - HR variables (imputation was needed)

HR variables were created and imputed:

* ceo_age: Age of CEO was calculated, missings were replaced by the mean and was winsorized to have values between [25, 75]. 
  * Flags were added to capture field qulity:
    * flag_low_ceo_age: flag was added if the age was below 25 years
    * flag_high_ceo_age: flag was added if the age was above 75 years
    * flag_miss_ceo_age: flag was added if the age was imputed
* ceo_young: Dummy was created to capture if the CEO is below 40 years old.
* labor_avg_mod: number of employees were imputed with the mean.
* foreign_management: firms where the foreign CEO rate was above 50% was flagged as foreign.

```{r}

# CEO age - Replace missings with mean, floor to 25, add ceilign to 75
data <- data %>%
  mutate(ceo_age = year-birth_year,
         flag_low_ceo_age = as.numeric(ceo_age < 25 & !is.na(ceo_age)),
         flag_high_ceo_age = as.numeric(ceo_age > 75 & !is.na(ceo_age)),
         flag_miss_ceo_age = as.numeric(is.na(ceo_age)))

data <- data %>%
  mutate(ceo_age = ifelse(ceo_age < 25, 25, ceo_age) %>%
           ifelse(. > 75, 75, .) %>%
           ifelse(is.na(.), mean(., na.rm = TRUE), .),
         ceo_young = as.numeric(ceo_age < 40))

# Number of employees (very noisy measure) - Replace missings with mean
data <- data %>%
  mutate(labor_avg_mod = ifelse(is.na(labor_avg), mean(labor_avg, na.rm = TRUE), labor_avg),
         flag_miss_labor_avg = as.numeric(is.na(labor_avg)))

# Foreign management
data <- data %>% mutate(foreign_management = as.numeric(foreign >= 0.5))

```

### Additional filters and drop unused fields

* Unused factor levels were dropped
* Firms with missing key variables were dropped from the dataset instead of imputing them.
* Unused fields were removed from the dataset


```{r}
# Drop unused factor levels
data <- data %>%
  mutate_at(vars(colnames(data)[sapply(data, is.factor)]), funs(fct_drop))

# Drop obs if key vars missing
data <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(liq_assets_bs),!is.na(foreign), !is.na(ind), !is.na(age), !is.na(material_exp_pl), !is.na(m_region_loc))

# Unused fields
drops <- c("D",
            "founded_year",
            "exit_year",
            "foreign",
            "birth_year",
            "inoffice_days",
            "gender",
            "origin",
            "nace_main",
            "ind",
            "region_m",
            "founded_date",
            "exit_date",
            "status_alive",
            "ind2",
            "begin",
            "end",
            "amort",
           "labor_avg"
           )

data <- data %>% select(-drops)

# Save dataset
saveRDS(data, paste0(data_work, "/bisnode_firms_cleaned.rds"))




```
